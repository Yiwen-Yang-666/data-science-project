# data-science-project

The first one project introduced an improved K-NN model predicting daily weather. Based on this model, I proposed a modified version predicting monthly weather. But this was just an idea and not tested.

The second project applied seven machine learning algorithms for a gene association study.After data preprocessing (Missing data; Introduction to dummy variable; feature selection), some failed machine learning algorithms attempted, including Multilayer Perceptron, Restricted Boltamann Machine, and Logistic Regression. Other methods tried, such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Kernel based SVM, with reasonable results obtained.
