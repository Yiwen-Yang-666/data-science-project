# data-science-project
This project includes two projects I participated in 

The first one project introduce an improved K-NN model for daily weather. Based on this model, I proposed a modified version for monthly weather. 
But this is just an idea and not tested and published.

The second project is related to feature selection and classification for a gene association sudy.
